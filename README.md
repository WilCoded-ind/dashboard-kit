## ERD

![ERD](./docs/erd.png)

> Table structure:
> - `users` — stores user accounts, linked to a role
> - `roles` — stores available roles (e.g. Admin, Mandor, Kawil, User)
> - `menus` — stores navigation menus with parent-child support
> - `permissions` — stores per-role, per-menu permission flags

---

## Flow

```
Admin creates menus
        |
Admin creates roles
        |
Admin assigns users to a role
        |
Admin opens permission page per role
        |
Permission page shows all menus (parent as label, child/standalone with checkboxes)
        |
Admin checks can_view / can_create / can_edit / can_delete per menu
        |
Permissions saved — applied to all users under that role
```
